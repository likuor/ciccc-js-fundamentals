"Fizzbuzz" is a famous interview question used in programming interviews. It goes something like this:

Loop through the numbers 1 to 100
If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number

TIP: A number x is divisible by a number y if the answer to x / y has a remainder of 0. 
For example, 10 is divisible by 2 because 10 / 2 = 5 with no remainder. 
You can check if a number is divisible by another number by checking if x % y === 0.

var x = 1;

while (/* your stop condition goes here */) {
    // check divisibility
    // print Julia, James, or JuliaJames
    // increment x
}
