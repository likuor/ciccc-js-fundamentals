/*
"Fizzbuzz" is a famous interview question used in programming interviews. It goes something like this:

Loop through the numbers 1 to 100
If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number

TIP: A number x is divisible by a number y if the answer to x / y has a remainder of 0.
For example, 10 is divisible by 2 because 10 / 2 = 5 with no remainder.
You can check if a number is divisible by another number by checking if x % y === 0.

var x = 1;

while (x <= 100) {
  if (x % 3 == 0 && x % 5 == 0) {
    console.log('FizzBuzz');
  } else if (x % 3 == 0) {
    console.log('Fizz');
  } else if (x % 5 == 0) {
    console.log('Buzz');
  } else {
    console.log(x);
  }
  x++;
}
